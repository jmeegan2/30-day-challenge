# 30 Day Challenge

A simple web app to help you track your daily goals and progress for 30 days.

## Features
- Interactive 5x6 checkbox grid to mark daily progress
- Add, edit, and delete up to 30 goals
- Progress and goals are saved automatically in your browser (using localStorage)
- No sign-in requiredâ€”your data stays private and persists between visits
- Clean, modern UI

## How it works
- All your progress and goals are stored in your browser's localStorage.
- Your data will remain even if you close the tab or browser, as long as you use the same device and browser.
- If you clear your browser data or use a different device/browser, your progress will not carry over.

## Deploying
- You can deploy this app easily with GitHub Pages or any static site host.
- Just upload the files (`home.html`, `main.js`, `style.css`) to your hosting platform.
